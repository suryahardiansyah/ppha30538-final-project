# Introduction

## Background
- Carjacking is a pressing urban issue, with significant impacts on public safety, insurance policies, and law enforcement resource allocation.
- According to [**WTTW News**](https://news.wttw.com/2023/08/21/carjackings-rise-illinois-looks-curb-growing-crime) in 2023, Chicago is reporting more incidents than any other city in the United States.
- Carjacking incidents in Chicago vary widely across neighborhoods and time, requiring data-driven interventions. 

## Research Questions
- How do temporal and spatial patterns of carjacking incidents in Chicago inform actionable policy and solutions?

# Methods in Data Analysis (1)

## Data Sources
* Chicago Data Portal: Carjacking Incidents (2001-2024) and Chicago Community Area Boundaries (GeoJSON format)

## Key Data Attributes:
* Incident date, time, and coordinates
* Neighborhood area boundaries

## Data Preparation:
1. API-based data retrieval (pagination used to overcome 1,000-row limit)
2. Spatial Joins and aggregations by year, month, and time of day

# Methods in Data Analysis (2)

## Visualization and Shiny Dashboard
* **Static choropleth maps** and **line charts** to explore trends.
* Shiny app for dynamic filtering by neighborhood and date range.

## Challenges:
1. **API Limitations**: The Chicago Data Portal limits API downloads to 1,000 rows per request, hence we used pagination to retrieve all 22,192 records.
2. **Data gaps**: Missing or incomplete records, such as missing coordinates, were excluded from the analysis (144 data rows per November 30th, 2024).

# Natural Language Processing Analysis and Limitations

## **SerpAPI Data Collection**
* Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze Polarity (Positive/Negative Sentiment) and Subjectivity (Degree of opinion/bias) with 1000 observations (2021-2024)
* Data sources: Google search results, news websites, and public repositories.
* Queries used: "Chicago car insurance policy", "auto insurance Chicago", "carjacking auto insurance Chicago", "auto insurance Chicago car theft", "Chicago carjacking", and "Chicago car theft"

## Limitations and Biases:
* Most of the insurance keyword extracts from insurance company website.
* Search results may prioritize recent high-profile cases, overlooking older or less-publicized incidents.
* Overrepresentation of specific neighborhoods based on media priorities.
* The news sources focus more on recent events, historical trends might be incomplete.

# Spatial Patterns

## Findings
* Hotspot Neighborhoods: **Austin, West and East Garfield Park, Englewood**.
* These neighborhoods economic challenges, high-crime level, and limited infrastructure.
* Policy implication: Localized interventions (e.g., police patrols, infrastructure upgrades)

# Temporal Trends

## What might explain the 2020-2021 spike? 
* **Pandemic disruptions** - reduced police presence in the neighborhood.
* **Economic uncertainty** - promote more people into crime.
* Police resource reallocation during social unrest.

# Shiny Interactive Dashboard
* Dynamic choropleth map for spatial analysis with date and neighborhood filters
* Dynamic line charts for time series analysis with date and neighborhood filters
* Empowers policymakers and stakeholders to explore patterns interactively

# NLP Analysis: Polarity and Subjectivity

# NLP Key Findings
* Insurance-related discussions (e.g. "auto insurance Chicago") are more positive and subjective, likely due coverage of financial protections and consumer advice.
* Crime-related discussions are neutral to slightly negative (e.g. "Chicago carjacking", and "Chicago car theft") - lower polarity and less subjective framing (more factual and data-driven rather than opinions).

# Policy Implications: Data-Driven adjustments
* Hotspot-based Policing: More patrols in Austin, West/East Garfield Park, and Englewood.
* Infrastructure improvement: lighting, surveillance cameras, community safety programs.
* Time-Based Resource Allocation: Deploy more law enforcement at night and during high-crime periods (e.g. 2020-2021 spikes).
* Proactive crime mitigation during external shocks (e.g. economic crises).
* Insurance premiums should be risk-adjusted based on carjacking incidence rates (e.g. higher premiums in high-risk areas like Austin and lower premiums in Hyde Park). 

# Conclusions

## Key Takeaways:
* Combining spatial, temporal, and sentiment analysis provides a holistic view of carjacking trends and public perceptions.

## Future Directions:
1. Integrate additional datasets (e.g. traffic patterns, socioeconomic factors)
2. Enhancing the dashboardâ€™s interactivity and performance by optimizing data structures will improve user experience and scalability.
