# Introduction

## Background
- Carjacking is a pressing urban issue, with significant impacts on public safety, insurance policies, and law enforcement resource allocation.
- According to [WTTW News](https://news.wttw.com/2023/08/21/carjackings-rise-illinois-looks-curb-growing-crime) in 2023, Chicago is reporting more incidents than any other city in the United States.
- Carjacking incidents in Chicago vary widely across neighborhoods and time. 

## Research Questions
- How do temporal and spatial patterns of carjacking incidents in Chicago inform actionable policy and insurance solutions?

# Methods in Data Analysis (1)

## Data Sources
* Chicago Data Portal: Carjacking Incidents (2001-2024) and Chicago Community Area Boundaries (GeoJSON)

## Key Data Attributes:
* Incident date, time, and coordinates
* Neighborhood area boundaries

## Data Preparation:
1. API-based data retrieval
2. Spatial Joins and aggregations by year, month, and time of day

# Methods in Data Analysis (2)

## Visualization and Shiny Dashboard
* Static choropleth maps and line charts to explore trends.
* Shiny app for dynamic filtering by neighborhood and date range.

## NLP Analysis
* Collected text data on Chicago auto insurance, carjacking, and insurance policy using web scraping and APIs and Applied NLP for sentiment analysis: Subjectivity and Polarity

## Challenges faced:
1. **API Limitations**: The Chicago Data Portal limits API downloads to 1,000 rows per request, hence we used pagination to retrieve all 22,192 records.
2. **Data gaps**: Missing or incomplete records, such as missing coordinates, required exclusion (144 data rows per November 30th, 2024).

# Spatial Patterns

## Analysis
* Hotspot Neighborhoods: **Austin, West and East Garfield Park, Englewood**.
* Hotspots align with areas facing economic challenges and limited community infrastructure
* Suggests localized interventions for those areas

# Temporal Trends

## What might explain the 2020-2021 spike? 
* Pandemic disruptions
* Economic uncertainty
* Police resource reallocation during social unrest

# Shiny Interactive Dashboard
* Dynamic choropleth map for spatial analysis with date and neighborhood filters
* Dynamic line charts for time series analysis with date and neighborhood filters
* Empowers policymakers and stakeholders to explore patterns interactively

# NLP Analysis: Polarity and Subjectivity

# Policy Implications
## Targeted Interventions for Hotspots:
* Increased patrols and community safety programs.
* Infrastructure improvements (lighting, cameras).

## Temporal Resource Allocation:
* Deploy resources strategically during crime spikes.
* Prepare for surges in external crises.

## Fairer Insurance Policies:
* Risk-based pricing.
* Incentives for safety measures.
* Collaboration between insurers and law enforcement.

# Conclusions

## Key Takeaways:
* Combining spatial, temporal, and sentiment analysis provides a holistic view of carjacking trends and public perceptions

## Future Directions:
1. Integrate additional datasets (e.g. traffic patterns, socioeconomic factors)
2. Enhancing the dashboardâ€™s interactivity and performance by optimizing data structures will improve user experience and scalability.
