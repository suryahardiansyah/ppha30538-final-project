# Group 28 Members:
* Astari Raihanah (CNetID: astari) - GitHub username: astari1007

Both of us are coming from Section 2 of Professor Ganong's lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 10:30-11:50 AM).

# Research Question
This project examines the temporal and spatial patterns of carjacking incidents across Chicago neighborhoods from 2001 until 2024. The primary goal is to identify carjacking hotspots and temporal trends to provide actionable insights for policymakers and insurance companies aiming to design fair and efficient insurance policies and targeted crime prevention strategies.

# Approach
## Data and Tools
We utilized datasets from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org), including:

1. **Carjacking Data**: Provides details of carjacking incidents, including date, time, and coordinates from 2001 to 2024.
2. **Neighborhood Boundaries**: Geospatial data to associate carjackings with specific neighborhoods.  
Our analysis includes data wrangling, static visualizations using **Altair**, and dynamic exploration via **Shiny Dashboard** in Python.

## Data Wrangling
### Key Steps
1. **Data Acquisition**: Carjacking reports retrieved from the Chicago Data Portal using API pagination stored locally as a CSV file. Neighborhood Boundaries is downlaoded as a GeoJSON file via a single API request and stored locally.
2. **Data Preparation**: The already structured datasets required no cleaning, and spatial join merged carjacking incidents with neighborhood boundaries using coordinate variables.
3. **Data Aggregation**: Dataset is grouped by Year, Month and Time of Day (Morning, Afternoon, and Evening) for temporal trend analysis.
4. **Visualization**: By static choropleth map and static line chart, identifying patterns by neighborhood and trend over time.
5. **Interactive Dashboard**: Using Shiny to built dynamic filtering of data by neighborhood and date range by choropleth map.
6. **Storage and Reproducibility**: All raw and processed data files are stored in a local 'data' directory. Documentation ensures reproducibility of the analysis and visualizations.

### Challenges
1. **API Limitations**: The Chicago Data Portal limits API downloads to 1,000 rows per request, hence we used pagination to retrieve all 22,192 records.
2. **Data gaps**: Missing or incomplete records, such as missing coordinates, required exclusion (144 data rows per November 30th, 2024).

# Static Plots
## 1. Choropleth Map: Carjacking Incidents by Neighborhood
This map visualizes carjacking incidents by neighborhood. Some neighborhoods such as Austin, West Garfield Park, East Garfield Park, Englewood, and West Englewood have higher carjacking counts. These neighborhoods should be prioritized for policy interventions, such as increased patrolling or community safety programs.

## 2. Line Chart: Carjacking Trends Over Time
This chart highlights trends in carjacking incidents over time. A sharp increase is evident around 2020, peaking in 2021. This trend may reflect broader societal disruptions, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic turmoil. Policymakers could use this data to explore the impact of external events on crime rates.

# Shiny Dashboard
The **Interactive Carjacking Dashboard** enables users to:

1. Explore carjacking patterns dynamically using a **Choropleth Map** filtered by neighborhood and date range. 
2. Visualize temporal patterns through a **Line Chart** with customizable filters for precise analysis.

# Strengths
* **Dynamic Exploration**: Offers flexibility to investigate specific neighborhoods or time periods. 
* **Policy Relevance**: Combines spatial and temporal data for actionable insights.

# Weaknesses
* **Performance**: Processing large datasets slows responsiveness
* **Data Limitations**: Missing records in the dataset can affect accuracy.

# Policy Implications
## 1. Neighborhood Hotspots: Targeted Interventions
Neighborhoods like Austin, West Garfield Park, East Garfield Park, Englewood, and West Englewood are carjacking hotspots, requiring focused interventions. 

* **Policy Actions**: Increase police patrols during high-risk hours, implement community safety programs like neighborhood watch and workshops, improve infrastructure like installing street lighting and surveillance cameras, and invest in socioeconomic support like job training and education.

## 2. Temporal Patterns: Addressing Crime Spikes
The sharp increase in carjackings during 2020-2021 and patterns in seasons and times of day highlight actionable trends. 

* **Policy Actions**: Allocate law enforcement resources during high-crime months and times, and prepare for crime surges during external crises such as pandemics or economic crises. 

## 3. Insurance Policies: Data-Driven Solutions
Car insurance often unfairly penalizes residents of high-crime areas. Policies should prioritize fairness. 

* **Policy Actions**: Use risk-based pricing focused on individual factors, incentivize safety measures such as giving discounts for anti-theft devices, require transparency in how crime stats influence premiums, and collaborate with law enforcement to lower risks and premiums.

* **Broader Considerations**: Adress poverty and unemployment in high-crime neighborhoods, collaborate with residents to foster trust and safety, and regularly assess the effectiveness of interventions using updated data. 

# Future Directions
Future work should focus on integrating additional datasets, such as police reports and traffic patterns, to provide deeper insights into carjacking trends and their underlying causes. Enhancing the dashboardâ€™s interactivity and performance by optimizing data structures will improve user experience and scalability. Additionally, evaluating the impact of crime prevention measures through comparative analysis of pre- and post-intervention data will help assess policy effectiveness and inform future strategies.
